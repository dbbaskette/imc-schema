**Advanced Machine Learning System for Real-Time Driver Safety Assessment**

</div>

---

## 📊 **System Overview**

The Safe Driver Scoring System uses **MADlib machine learning** on **Greenplum** to analyze real-time telemetry data and predict driver safety. The system combines **supervised learning** with **business intelligence** to generate actionable safety scores from 0-100.

### 🎯 **Key Metrics**
- **📈 15 Active Drivers** being monitored
- **🔢 2,400+ Telemetry Events** analyzed
- **🧠 Logistic Regression Model** with 93%+ accuracy
- **⚡ Real-time Scoring** updates every 30 seconds

---

## 🧠 **Machine Learning Algorithm Explained**

### **Algorithm Choice: Logistic Regression**

**Why Logistic Regression?** 🤔
```
✅ Interpretable Results    - Stakeholders can understand feature weights
✅ Probability Outputs      - Gives risk percentages, not just classifications  
✅ Fast Training/Scoring    - Real-time updates with new telemetry data
✅ Handles Small Datasets   - Works well with our 15-driver dataset
✅ Feature Importance       - Shows which behaviors matter most
```

**Alternative Algorithms Considered:**
- ❌ **Neural Networks**: Too complex for dataset size, black box
- ❌ **Random Forest**: Less interpretable, harder to explain to regulators
- ❌ **SVM**: No probability outputs, harder to tune
- ❌ **K-Means Clustering**: Unsupervised, can't predict accidents

### **MADlib Implementation**

```sql
-- MADlib Logistic Regression Training
SELECT madlib.logregr_train(
    'driver_ml_training_data',                    -- Training dataset
    'driver_accident_model',                      -- Output model table
    'has_accident',                               -- Target variable (0/1)
    'ARRAY[1, speed_compliance_rate, avg_g_force, 
           harsh_driving_events, phone_usage_rate, 
           speed_variance]',                      -- Feature vector
    NULL,                                         -- No grouping
    20,                                           -- Max iterations
    'irls'                                        -- Iteratively Reweighted Least Squares
);
```

**Model Output:**
```
🎯 Target Variable: has_accident (binary: 0 = no accidents, 1 = accidents)
📊 Training Accuracy: Correctly identified all 3 accident-prone drivers
🔢 Probability Range: 0.0000 to 1.0000 (converted to safety scores 0-100)
```

## 📋 **Feature Engineering Deep Dive**

### **Primary Features (Input to ML Model)**

#### **1. 🚦 Speed Compliance Rate** **(Weight: 40%)**
```sql
speed_compliance_rate = (total_events - violations) / total_events * 100
```
**Why Important:**
- **Legal Compliance**: Direct correlation with traffic violations
- **Risk Indicator**: Speeding increases accident probability exponentially
- **Measurable**: Clear, objective metric from GPS data

**Example Values:**
- 👑 **Driver 400011**: 90.71% (Excellent)
- ⚠️ **Driver 400008**: 69.18% (Poor)

#### **2. 🏁 Average G-Force** **(Weight: 25%)**
```sql
avg_g_force = AVG(g_force) FROM accelerometer_data
```
**Why Important:**
- **Driving Smoothness**: Lower g-force = smoother, safer driving
- **Aggressive Behavior**: High g-force indicates hard braking/acceleration
- **Predictive Power**: Correlates with loss of vehicle control

**Thresholds:**
- 🟢 **Safe**: < 1.2 G (smooth driving)
- 🟡 **Caution**: 1.2 - 1.5 G (moderate)
- 🔴 **Dangerous**: > 1.5 G (harsh driving)

#### **3. ⚡ Harsh Driving Events** **(Weight: 15%)**
```sql
harsh_driving_events = COUNT(*) WHERE g_force > 1.5
```
**Why Important:**
- **Behavior Frequency**: Not just average, but frequency of risky moments
- **Early Warning**: Identifies aggressive patterns before accidents
- **Intervention Trigger**: Actionable metric for coaching

#### **4. 📱 Phone Usage Rate** **(Weight: 15%)**
```sql
phone_usage_rate = COUNT(*) WHERE device_screen_on = true AND speed_mph > 5
```
**Why Important:**
- **Distracted Driving**: Leading cause of accidents (NHTSA data)
- **Legal Risk**: Many jurisdictions ban phone use while driving
- **Behavioral**: Indicates safety consciousness

#### **5. 📊 Speed Variance** **(Weight: 5%)**
```sql
speed_variance = STDDEV(speed_mph)
```
**Why Important:**
- **Consistency**: Steady drivers are safer drivers
- **Traffic Flow**: Erratic speed affects other drivers
- **Attention**: High variance may indicate distraction

### **Secondary Features (Business Logic)**

#### **🚨 Accident History**
```sql
accident_count = COUNT(*) FROM accidents WHERE driver_id = X
```
**Impact**: Direct 30-point penalty per accident

#### **🛣️ Excessive Speeding**
```sql
excessive_speeding = COUNT(*) WHERE speed_mph > speed_limit_mph + 10
```
**Impact**: 20-point penalty for extreme violations

    model_coefficients, 
    feature_vector
)
```

### **Stage 3: Score Calculation**
```sql
-- Hybrid ML + Business Rules Approach
CASE 
    WHEN accident_probability > 0.5 THEN 
        -- High-risk penalty: Base score - 20 points
        base_composite_score - 20
    ELSE 
        -- Normal calculation
        (speed_compliance * 0.4) +
        (smoothness_score * 0.25) +
        (harsh_events_score * 0.15) +
        (distraction_score * 0.15) +
        (accident_history * 0.05)
END
```
