I am building a demo application that simulates much of an auto insurance company.  I am using Greenplum database ofr my data storage.  I need customer info, policy info, a driver safety score table, accident records, claims, and any others you think would be useful.  Create the schema, and then also create a good amount of sample data for everything except sadety score which will get rows later.  If you look in /Users/dbbaskette/Projects/insurance-megacorp/imc-telematics-gen you will find the telemtry generator and it shows the kind of policy numbers, and information we will have in the case of an accident. You should have access to the directory in this workspace...just dont modify anything in it
